                        <h2>The Basics of Mindfulness Practice</h2>
                        <p>Mindfulness helps us put some space between ourselves and our reactions, breaking down our conditioned responses. Here’s how to tune into mindfulness throughout 
                            the day:</p>
                        <ul class="no-list-style">
                            <li><span class="bold">Set aside some time. </span>You don’t need a meditation cushion or bench, or any sort of special equipment to access your mindfulness skills—but 
                                you do need to set aside some time and space.
                            </li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Observe the present moment as it is. </span>The aim of mindfulness is not quieting the mind, or attempting to achieve a state of eternal calm. 
                                The goal is simple: we’re aiming to pay attention to the present moment, without judgment. Easier said than done, we know.
                            </li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Let your judgments roll by.</span> When we notice judgments arise during our practice, we can make a mental note of them, and let them pass.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Return to observing the present moment as it is. </span>Our minds often get carried away in thought. That’s why mindfulness is the practice of 
                                returning, again and again, to the present moment.
                            </li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Be kind to your wandering mind. </span>Don’t judge yourself for whatever thoughts crop up, just practice recognizing when your mind has wandered off, 
                                and gently bring it back.<sup><a href="#footer">[1]</a></sup>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>How to Meditate</h2>
                        <p>This meditation focuses on the breath, not because there is anything special about it, but because the physical sensation of breathing is always there and you can use it as 
                            an anchor to the present moment. Throughout the practice you may find yourself caught up in thoughts, emotions, sounds—wherever your mind goes, simply come back again to the 
                            next breath. Even if you only come back once, that’s okay.
                        </p>
                        <h3>A Simple Meditation Practice</h3>
                        <ul class="no-list-style">
                            <li><span class="bold">Sit comfortably. </span>Find a spot that gives you a stable, solid, comfortable seat.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Notice what your legs are doing. </span>If on a cushion, cross your legs comfortably in front of you. If on a chair, rest the bottoms of your feet on the floor.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Straighten your upper body. </span>But don’t stiffen. Your spine has natural curvature. Let it be there.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Notice what your arms are doing. </span>Situate your upper arms parallel to your upper body. Rest the palms of your hands on your legs wherever it feels most natural.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Soften your gaze. </span>Drop your chin a little and let your gaze fall gently downward. It’s not necessary to close your eyes. You can simply let what appears before your eyes be there without focusing on it.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Feel your breath. </span>Bring your attention to the physical sensation of breathing: the air moving through your nose or mouth, the rising and falling of your belly, or your chest.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Notice when your mind wanders from your breath. </span> Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. Don’t worry. There’s no need to block or eliminate thinking. 
                                When you notice your mind wandering gently return your attention to the breath.
                            </li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Be kind about your wandering mind.</span>You may find your mind wandering constantly—that’s normal, too. Instead of wrestling with your thoughts, practice observing them without reacting. Just sit and pay attention. As hard as it is to maintain, that’s all there is. Come back to your breath over and over again, without judgment or expectation.</li>
                            <li><span class="bold">When you’re ready, gently lift your gaze </span>(if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.<sup><a href="#footer">[1]</a></sup></li>

                        <h2>Basic Mindfulness Exercises</h2>
                        <p>This exercise teaches basic mindfulness meditation:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sit on a straight-backed chair or cross-legged on the floor.</li>
                            <li>Focus on an aspect of your breathing, such as the sensations of air flowing into your nostrils and out of your mouth, or your belly rising and falling as you inhale and exhale.</li>
                            <li>Once you’ve narrowed your concentration in this way, begin to widen your focus. Become aware of sounds, sensations, and your ideas.</li>
                            <li>Embrace and consider each thought or sensation without judging it good or bad. If your mind starts to race, return your focus to your breathing. Then expand your awareness again.<sup><a href="#footer">[2]</a></sup></li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2>Learning to Stay in the Present</h2>
                        <p>A less formal approach to mindfulness can also help you to stay in the present and fully participate in your life. You can choose any task or moment to practice informal mindfulness, 
                            whether you are eating, showering, walking, touching a partner, or playing with a child or grandchild. Attending to these points will help:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Start by bringing your attention to the sensations in your body.</li>
                            <li>Breathe in through your nose, allowing the air downward into your lower belly. Let your abdomen expand fully.</li>
                            <li>Now breathe out through your mouth.</li>
                            <li>Notice the sensations of each inhalation and exhalation.</li>
                            <li>Proceed with the task at hand slowly and with full deliberation.</li>
                            <li>Engage your senses fully. Notice each sight, touch, and sound so that you savor every sensation.</li>
                            <li>When you notice that your mind has wandered from the task at hand, gently bring your attention back to the sensations of the moment.<sup><a href="#footer">[2]</a></sup></li>
