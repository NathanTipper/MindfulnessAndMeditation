                        <h2>Mindfulness Reduces Anxiety</h2>
                        <p>I started practicing mindfulness and meditation because of debilitating anxiety. Much of the work I do as a lawyer requires anticipating all the bad things 
                            that can happen in a case—conditions ripe for anxiety. In a 2013 Massachusetts General Hospital study, 93 individuals with DSM-IV-diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were 
                            randomly assigned to an 8-week group intervention with mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) or to a control group, stress management education (SME). The group that went through 
                            the MBSR program was associated with a significantly greater reduction in anxiety.<sup><a href="#footer">[1]</a></sup><br>

                        <h2>Mindfulness Meditation Reduces Implicit Age and Race Bias</h2>
                        <p>Humans naturally rely on established associations and cognitive shortcuts to navigate through the world. Some shortcuts are necessary--for example, knowing your bias towards what you 
                            prefer to eat for breakfast. However, these associations can be destructive when it comes to certain biases, especially related to age and race. In the criminal law context, for 
                            instance, it's crucial that everyone involved in the system, from police officers, prosecutors and defense attorneys to the judges, be mindful of their own biases.<sup><a href="#footer">[1]</a></sup><br>

                        <h2>Mindfulness Meditation Help The Brain Reduce Distractions</h2>
                        <p>Training the mind to focus and concentrate is becoming more critical than ever in this 24/7 world where our attention is being pulled in 100 different direction at once. 
                            In a Harvard study, researchers reported that “brain cells use particular frequencies, or waves, to regulate the flow of information in much the same way that radio stations 
                            broadcast at specific frequencies. One frequency, the alpha rhythm, is particularly active in the cells that process touch, sight and sound in the brain’s outermost layer, 
                            called the cortex, where it helps to suppress irrelevant or distracting sensations and regulate the flow of sensory information between brain regions.”<sup><a href="#footer">[1]</a></sup><br>
