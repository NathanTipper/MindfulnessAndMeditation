                    <p id="mind-item-1">Here’s an all-purpose definition that treats mindfulness as a quality that every human being already possesses, rather than something we have to conjure up:

                            Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.
                            
                            While mindfulness is innate, it can be cultivated through proven techniques, particularly seated, walking, standing, and moving meditation (it’s also possible lying down but 
                            often leads to sleep); short pauses we insert into everyday life; and merging meditation practice with other activities, such as yoga or sports.<sup><a href="#footer">[1]</a></sup>

                                Being mindful makes it easier to savor the pleasures in life as they occur, helps you become fully engaged in activities, and creates a greater capacity to deal 
                                with adverse events. By focusing on the here and now, many people who practice mindfulness find that they are less likely to get caught up in worries about the 
                                future or regrets over the past, are less preoccupied with concerns about success and self-esteem, and are better able to form deep connections with others.

                            <li><span class="bold">Mindfulness improves physical health. </span>If greater well-being isn’t enough of an incentive, scientists have discovered that mindfulness techniques help improve physical health in a number of ways.

                        <h2>What is Meditation?</h2>
                        <p>Meditation is exploring. It’s not a fixed destination. Your head doesn’t become vacuumed free of thought, utterly undistracted. It’s a special place where each and every 
                            moment is momentous. When we meditate we venture into the workings of our minds: our sensations (air blowing on our skin or a harsh smell wafting into the room), our 
                            emotions (love this, hate that, crave this, loathe that) and thoughts (wouldn’t it be weird to see an elephant playing a trumpet).

                            Mindfulness meditation asks us to suspend judgment and unleash our natural curiosity about the workings of the mind, approaching our experience with warmth and kindness, to ourselves and others.<sup><a href="#footer">[1]</a></sup></p>

                                our brains in ways once science said is impossible. When we train our mind to focus  we are happy. Keeping your attention focused on the present, accepting the moment without judgment,

                                behavior and cognitive functions.  A 2005 study on American men and women who meditated a mere 40 minutes a day showed that their brains displayed thicker cortical walls than non-meditators. What 
                                this could possibly mean is that their brains were aging at a slower rate. Cortical thickness is also associated with decision making, attention and memory.

                                ability to multitask. A study by the University of Washington showed that people who practiced mindfulness meditation two hours a week for eight weeks had better focus during multitasking tests than 
                                those who didn’t. Why is this – you asked? The main reason is because meditation practice allowed them to notice interruptions and distractions without losing focus on their present task!<sup><a href="#footer">[4]</a></sup>

                        <p>Mindfulness can be cultivated through mindfulness meditation, a systematic method of focusing your attention. Mindfulness meditation is a form of mental training that 
                            cultivates non-judgmental observation, non-striving, patience, trust, open-mindedness, self-compassion and non-attachment. You can learn to meditate on your own, following 
                            instructions in books or on tape. However, you may benefit from the support of an instructor or group to answer questions and help you stay motivated. Look for someone using 
                            meditation in a way compatible with your beliefs and goals.<sup><a href="#footer">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#footer">[5]</a></sup>
