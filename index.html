                <h2>How Stress Affects Us</h2>
                <div class="stress-info-grid-container-3">
                    <p id="stress-item-1">One of the difficulties with stress is that people experience stress in different ways. 
                        This contributes to stress manifesting itself differently. So it would be wrong to over generalise when giving 
                        advice on how to identify stress in others. However, what we can say is that because stress has negative effects, 
                        it will usually manifest itself one way or another. <br><br>
                        Stress targets the weakest part of our physiology or character; 
                        if you are prone to headaches or eczema, this will flare up.  If you have low levels of patience or tolerance for others, 
                        this will be the first area to present under times of stress. Stress isn’t avoidable but it is manageable. A key action 
                        in order to minimise risk is to identify stress-related problems as early as possible, so that action can be taken before
                        serious stress-related illness occurs.

                    <p id="stress-item-3"> These changes may be emotional, physical or behavioural, or a combination of all three. So, the key thing is to look out 
                        for negative changes of any kind. Bear in mind that the negative changes are also likely to have knock-on effects e.g. 
                        reduced performance at work.

                        Of course, we all experience ‘bad days’, so we are really talking about situations where people display these negative 
                        changes for a period of time (e.g. 5 days in a row).

                    <p id="stress-item-5">
                        Prolonged stress undoubtedly makes people ill. It is now known to contribute to heart disease, hypertension and 
                        high blood pressure, it affects the immune system, is linked to strokes, IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome), ulcers, 
                        diabetes, muscle and joint pain, miscarriage, allergies, alopecia and even premature tooth loss. For more detail
                        about how stress affects the body, please take a few minutes to watch the video presented by TED talks.
